“HyperSpan” is a software as a service which can be used by many organizations or individual uses for developing and planning projects. It can be used to showcase any organization or an individual’s project achievements and allow them to post (blog, Image, videos, etc) publically. Organizations can use it to hire resources they require or any individual user who needs to find someone to help in their project.
 Users can create new projects and fill out some basic information regarding their project and list of their competitors will be shown. They can see the features they provide. Help users finalize their requirements and create user flows/flowcharts.
When two or more individuals/organizations work collaboratively on any project, they will sign some agreement and contracts with “HyperSpan” platform and not directly with the other party.
The end user will have to pay for using the platform after exceeding the free user limit or when any contract/agreement is signed.
